# C CONTAINER TEMPLATE LIBRARY (CTL)

CTL is a fast compiling, type safe, header only, template-like
container library for ISO C99/C11.

## Use

Configure a CTL container with a built-in or typedef type `T`.

```C
    #include <stdio.h>

    #define POD
    #define T int
    #include <ctl_vector.h>

    int compare(int* a, int* b) { return *b < *a; }

    int main(void)
    {
        vec_int a = vec_int_init();
        vec_int_push_back(&a, 9);
        vec_int_push_back(&a, 1);
        vec_int_push_back(&a, 8);
        vec_int_push_back(&a, 3);
        vec_int_push_back(&a, 4);
        vec_int_sort(&a, compare);
        foreach(vec_int, &a, it)
            printf("%d\n", *it.ref);
        vec_int_free(&a);
    }
```

Definition `POD` states type `T` is Plain Old Data (POD).

## Motivation

CTL aims to improve ISO C99/C11 developer productivity by implementing
all containers in ISO C99/C11:

| [ctl/array.h](docs/array.md)                   | std::array           | arrNNNN  |
| [ctl/map.h](docs/map.md)                       | std::map             | map      |

| [ctl/numeric.h](docs/numeric.md)               | `<numeric>`          |

In work:

[ctl/pair.h](docs/pair.md),
[ctl/hashmap.h](docs/hashmap.md),
[ctl/swisstable.h](docs/swisstable.md),
[ctl/btree.h](docs/btree.md),
[ctl/u8string.h](docs/u8string.md),
[ctl/u8ident.h](docs/u8ident.md).

map (with pairs), and some C++ methods, algorithms are in work still.

It is based on glouw's ctl, but with proper names, and using the incpath `ctl/` prefix.

multiset and multimap can be composed by set and list. Better open
flat hashmap's are in work as stanford hash variant for integer keys, and
swisstable for string keys, both with the `unordered_map` API.

## Memory Ownership

Types with memory ownership require definition `POD` be omitted, and require
function declarations for the C++ equivalent of the destructor and copy constructor,
prior to the inclusion of the container:

```C
    typedef struct { ... } type;
    void type_free(type*);
    type type_copy(type*);
    #define T type
    #include <ctl_vector.h>
```

Forgetting a declaration will print a human-readable error message:

```shell
tests/test_c11.c:11:11: error: ‘type_free’ undeclared (first use in this function)
   11 | #define T type
```

## Compare

In contrast to the original CTL, this applies default `compare` and `equal` methods
to all integral types T as `int`, `long`, `bool`, `char`, `short`, `float`, `double`, `char8_t`,
`uint8_t` - `uin64_t`, `int8_t` - `in64_t`.
Since T may not contain a space, we also accept `long double` as `ldbl`,
`long long` as `llong`, `unsigned int` as `uint` and `uint8_t` - `uin64_t`,
`unsigned long` as `ulong`, `unsigned char` as `uchar`.

Only with structs a `compare` and optionally an `equal` method must be set.
Removed the compare and equal args from `equal`, `sort`, `sort_range`, `find`,
`merge`, `unique`.

Without an `equal` method two `compare` calls are used, so having a special equal
method is preferred if one of those methods from above are used.

**2way vs 3way compare**: Officially only the lower-than `operator<` 2-way comparator
is supported, as in the STL. However, with the `set` core methods the 3way
comparator `<=>` (such as e.g. `memcmp`, `strcmp`) may also be used. Not with algorithms!
It is not faster with 3way, rather slower.

If you have a POD type, i.e. a struct with only integral types, i.e. no pointers, you
have to define `NOT_INTEGRAL`.

```C

    #define POD
    #define NOT_INTEGRAL
    #define T point
    #include <ctl_priority_queue.h>

    // or

    #define T digi
    #include <ctl_deque.h>

    deq_digi a = deq_digi_init();
    a.compare = digi_compare;
    a.equal = digi_equal;
```

Forgetting a compare method will assert with "compare undefined", if enabled.

## Iterators and Ranges

The special iterator objects created by `begin`, `end` and returned by `next`,
`advance` contain the current and the end position for ranges, 3 vtable methods,
and have more iterator specific fields contained within. Thus they are fat and
safe iterators.

Previous versions of the ctl (_with version numbers < 202000_) had different heavier
and incompatible iterators, initialized by `each`. Our iterators are as in the
STL initialized with `begin` or `end`, and for ranges with `range`.  Now they are
compatible with the STL and are safer.

We also support for certain algorithm methods **generic iterators** as 2nd range,
abstracting different containers. So we can insert a vector into a deque, or use
a mixed set algorithm with different container types. They are denoted as `GI*`,
generic iters, and can be simply casted from container-specific iterators.

See [iterators](docs/iterators.md).

Range methods are suffixed with `_range`, taking a single iterator as range,
similar to C++20 ranges, but the STL uses a pair of two iterators. We are using one.

## Performance

CTL performance is presented in solid colors, and STL in dotted colors,
for template type `T` as type `int` for all measurements.

![](docs/images/vec.log.png)
![](docs/images/list.log.png)
![](docs/images/slist.log.png)
![](docs/images/deq.log.png)
![](docs/images/set.log.png)
![](docs/images/uset.log.png)
![](docs/images/pqu.log.png)
![](docs/images/arr.log.png)
![](docs/images/str.log.png)
![](docs/images/compile.log.png)

Omitted from these performance measurements are `queue.h` and `stack.h`,
as their performance characteristics can be inferred from `deque.h`.
Likewise `map.h` from `set.h` and `unordered_map.h` from `unordered_set.h`.

`unordered_set.h` is defined with the default `CTL_USET_GROWTH_PRIMED`.
libstdc++ uses POWER2 by default, libc++ supports both, depending on the initial size.
`CTL_USET_GROWTH_POWER2` is here:

![](docs/images/uset_pow2.log.png)

`CTL_USET_CACHED_HASH` is here:

![](docs/images/uset_cached.log.png)

This trades memory for faster unsuccessful searches, such as with insert with
high load factor.

C is rougly comparable to C++ included, but note that most of the
C++ functions are dynaloaded from `libstdc++.so.6`, whilst the C versions are
directly in the binary.

## Security

The CTL is more opinionated on security than the STL.

The default **`max_size`** of containers is restricted to max 2^32 byte, i.e. 2GB,
to avoid DDOS attacks. Allocating an overlarge container may need several
minutes until it crashes. If you really need more than 2GB containers adjust
your `max_size` for your container.

The `unordered_set` hashtable has by default **security policies** enabled to avoid
**DDOS attacks** by exploiting weak hash functions or exposure of ordering on the
unfortunate linked-list chaining, demanded by the unfortunate C++ specs. The
usual random seed strategy is considered security theatre, but can be enabled by
`#define CTL_USET_SECURITY_COLLCOUNTING 0` and define a custom hash function
with a random seed.
See [unordered_set hash-policy](docs/unordered_set.md#hash-policy) and
[github.com/rurban/smhasher/#security](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/#security).

Using a mix of 3way and 2way comparators may lead to **endless loops** with certain
sequences only. The STL does nothing against it, we try to detect this at least in the
set core methods.

The CTL is **formally verified** via cbmc and satabs models for most core functions, the
STL not. Several STL bugs and limitations have been found by our extensive test suite. See
also [cprover.org/stl/](http://www.cprover.org/stl/) for <vector> and <list> verifications.

Proper unicode security practices are in work. The STL and most other libraries ignore
it. Esp. for identifiers, which need to be identifiable, but are not. But the
STL cannot even compare, i.e. find strings, only byte buffers.

## Running Tests

To run all functional tests, run:

```shell
make
```

To compile examples, run:

```shell
make examples
```

To generate performance graphs, run:

```shell
make images

# Graphing requires python3 and the Plotly family of libraries via pip3.
pip install plotly
pip install psutil
pip install kaleido
```

To do all of the above in one step, run:

```shell
./all.sh
```

The full CI suite is run via: (1-2 hrs)

```shell
./ci-all.sh
```

To generate the manpages or run `make install` install the `ronn` gem.

For maintaining CTL, a container templated to type `int` can be
output to `stdout` by running make on the container name with .i, eg:

```shell
make ctl/deque.i
make ctl/list.i
make ctl/priority_queue.i
make ctl/queue.i
make ctl/set.i
make ctl/stack.i
make ctl/string.i
make ctl/vector.i
make ctl/array.i
make ctl/map.i
make ctl/unordered_set.i
make ctl/unordered_map.i
make ctl/hashmap.i
make ctl/swisstable.i
make tests/func/test_c11.i
make tests/func/test_list.i
```

## Other

STL variants of multi-sets and multi-maps will not be implemented because
similar behaviour can be implemented as an amalgamation of a `set` and `list`.
See `tests/func/test_container_composing.cc`

UTF-8 strings and identifiers will be added eventually, Wide, UTF-16 or UTF-32
not. Parallel variants of all containers and algos in `pctl` with openmp are in
planning.

Many methods from algorithm, with iterators and range are now implemented, with
iterators changed from upstream.
Also implemented are type utilities to omit default compare, equal and hash methods
for POD integral types.

In planning are also `small_vector` (stack-allocated for performance),
`sorted_vector` and parallel, thread-safe variants in `pctl`.

## Differences

### Differences to the original <https://github.com/glouw/ctl>

`#include` with the `ctl/` prefix.

Use the original long names, not three-letter abbrevations.

`#define POD` not `P`

`#define NOT_INTEGRAL` not `COMPARE`

Our version number `CTL_VERSION` is greater than 202000 (starting with `202102`),
the old ctl is lower than 202000, starting with `1.0`.

Added lots of missing methods. We have 158 methods in 942 stable variants.
glouw has 63 methods in 196 stable variants.

inclusion of numeric via `#define INCLUDE_NUMERIC`. For now algorithm is always loaded.

Probe for -std=c++20 c++ support and use this for testing against the STL.
Fallback to c++2a, c++17 or c++11.

Added **array**, **map** and **unordered_map** containers; generic iterators
with a vtable.

Added docs and manpages.

Added builtin default `compare` and `equal` methods for the simple integral types T:
`int`, `long`, `bool`, `char`, `short`, `float`, `double`, `char8_t`,
`long double`, `long long`, `unsigned int`, `unsigned long`, `unsigned char`.
Only with structs a compare and optionally and equal method must be set.
Removed the compare and equal args from `equal`, `sort`, `sort_range`, `find`,
`merge`, `unique`
Added compare and equal fields to all.

Added many `_it` and `_range` method variants to accept iterator pairs or single
ranges, `_found` to return found or not.
Methods working on iterators don't need the container arg `(A* self)`.

    deque:  insert_range, insert_count, erase_range,
            emplace, emplace_back, emplace_front, sort_range
    vector: assign_range, erase_index, erase_range, insert_range, insert_count,
            emplace, emplace_back
    list:   remove, emplace, emplace_front, insert_range, insert_count
    set:    erase_node, erase_range
    map:    insert_or_assign
    umap:   insert_or_assign, insert_or_assign_found
    uset:   clear, equal, insert_found, union, difference, intersection,
            symmetric_difference, emplace, emplace_found, emplace_hint

vector `swap` does `shrink_to_fit` as in the STL.

The compare method is two-way `operator<` as in the STL, not `operator>` as in
glouw/ctl. We support two-way and three-way compare for set, which needs more
comparisons, but is safer.

Redesigned iterators and better range support. Much closer to the STL, and
much faster. Full generic iterator support is in `bits/iterator.h`,
`bits/iterator_vtable.h`, `algorithm.h`, the extended `range` methods,
and `foreach_range`, `foreach_n`, `foreach_n_range` macros.

Reproducible tests with `SEED=n`, many more test improvements.
Optimized test dependencies, time went from 25s to 3s even with ccache.

Optimized hashmaps with two growth policies and many security policies.  Faster
and more insecure with the policy `CTL_USET_GROWTH_POWER2` instead of the
default `CTL_USET_GROWTH_PRIMED`.  Added the `CTL_USET_CACHED_HASH` policy for
faster unsuccessful finds with high load factors, but more memory.  The default
`CTL_USET_SECURITY_COLLCOUNTING` policy is `2`, using a customizable `sleep()`
call on DDOS attack.

A flat `hashmap` and `swisstable` will be added with open addressing, thus no
internal bucket methods, and faster, but pointers into it are disallowed. Flat
sets and maps as open hashmaps and btree will support no pointer stability, and
no iterator stability.

Optimized `list`, seperate connect before and after methods.

Implemented correct string and vector capacity policies, as in gcc libstdc++ and
llvm libc++.  Tested also against the libc++ from llvm and the Windows MSVC STL,
not just the GNU libstdc++ v3.

Work is ongoing to finish the rest of `algorithm.h`, `numeric.h` and `memory.h`,
add `pair` for map and `btree_set`, add proper string and identifier support.
`string_view` and `span` (i.e. vector\_view) not yet planned.

On errors, like `size > max_size` return silently. This avoids DDOS attacks.
When assert is used, throw them. (when assert.h included, no NDEBUG. This is
simlar to the no-exception abseil)
glouw/ctl does not treat errors at all. There cannot be any.

Added formal verification tests for many functions, via `cbmc` for bounded loops
and `satabs` for unbounded lists, which even caught a set.find error not caught
by review, nor random testing nor sanitizers.

Support not only GNU make, but also BSD make and MSVC nmake.
`gen_images.sh` is not bash-only anymore, and supports updating single graphs.

Tested also on macOS (default apple clang++ with libc++), FreeBSD (default
clang with libc++), and Windows MSVC (default CL 19).

### Differences to the STL

Our iterators are safe and fat with an `end` range. We supprt the equivalent of
C++20 ranges (single arg iterator), not begin/end pairs.  Not as safe as
glouw/ctl iterators, but also not as slow. We need 2 assignments
(currently. will be fixed), the STL needs one assignment, glouw/ctl needs three
assignments. glouw/ctl is safe for destructive operations (i.e. insert, erase)
in a foreach loop, we and the STL are not.

Our iterators are generic only for certain algorithm methods, where we use
a 2nd range of any container type on a typed container. C++ classes use two
indirections on all vtable calls. We inline all our iterator vtables, which are very
short, 3 pointers, so we a tiny initialization overhead of 3 copies vs 1, but
have no call overhead, unlike with C++. Specific iterator calls are completely
inlined, only generic iterator calls in rare cases go through the vtable.

Our vector and string growth policies for multiple insertions are much better.
E.g. in the set algos or `insert_count`.
We reserve space at front, the STL piecewise in `push_back`/`insert` and this often
leads to massive overallocation, hitting `* 2`. We try to mimic the upstream
growth policies, but not its mistakes.

STL multiset and multimap variants will not be implemented because
similar behaviour can be implemented as an amalgamation of a `set` and `list`.

STL string_view, span and short string optimizations are still missing.

STL methods returning a pair of iterator and bool have a `_found` suffix,
return the iterator and set a `int *foundp` value. Eg.

    int found;
    map_T_insert_assign_found (self, key, &found);

Some algorithms and C++20 methods are still missing or are in work.

STL **set** algorithms such as `set_union`, `set_difference`, `set_intersection`,
`set_symmetric_difference` do not work with `unordered_set`, because the specs
require them to be ordered.  The CTL set algorithms do work properly on
`unordered_set`. Likewise we don't define any range iterators on unordered_set,
as this is unordered by default.

hashmaps will not rely on chained lists with buckets, and can be either changed
to open addressing or a better modern layout, such as Swiss tables (flat or
node variants), the stanford hash for integers or even the currently fastest
[greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap](https://github.com/greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap).
Thus the bucket interface methods will not be defined for all hashmap variants,
except maybe `max_bucket_count`. hashmap policies are compile-time defined via
`#define CTL_USET_...` and `#define CTL_HMAP_...`

**u8string** will get proper utf-8/unicode support, exceeding C++ STL.
compare will check u8strings normalized to NFD.
No wstring, u16string and u32string (most likely).

**u8ident**: POSIX std extension for people using utf-8 identifiers, but
need security. See <http://unicode.org/reports/tr39/>
Like a kernel filesystem or user database or programming language
in a UTF-8 terminal, UI widget or editor wishes to present identifiers, like
names, paths or files identifiable.
I.e. normalized and with identifiable characters only. Most don't display
names as puny-code as webbrowers or email clients.
Implement the **Moderately Restrictive** restriction level for identifiers as default.

* All characters in the string are in the ASCII range, or
* The string is single-script, according to the definition in TR39 Section 5.1, or
* The string is covered by any of the following sets of scripts, according to
  the definition in TR39 Section 5.1:
     Latin + Han + Hiragana + Katakana; or equivalently: Latn + Jpan
     Latin + Han + Bopomofo; or equivalently: Latn + Hanb
     Latin + Han + Hangul; or equivalently: Latn + Kore, or
* The string is covered by Latin and any one other Recommended script, except Cyrillic, Greek.
* The string must be validated UTF-8 and normalized, and only consist of valid identifier
  characters.
Reject violations, optionally warn about confusables.

No exceptions or errors. Just ignore or return NULL. If assert is included, use
it, with a proper error message.
No bloat and not many indirect calls (only compare and equal).
