# priority_queue - CTL - C Container Template library

Defined in header **<ctl_priority_queue.h>**, CTL prefix **pqu**,
derived from [vector](vector.md).

## SYNOPSIS

    static inline int
    int_cmp(int *a, int *b) {
      return *a < *b;
    }

    #define POD
    #define T int
    #include <ctl_priority_queue.h>

    pqu_int a = pqu_int_init (int_cmp);

    for (i=0; i<1000; i++)
      pqu_int_push(&a, rand());
    for (i=0; i<20; i++)
       pqu_int_pop(&a);

    pqu_int_free(&a);

## DESCRIPTION

A priority queue is a container adaptor that provides constant time lookup of
the largest (by default) element, at the expense of logarithmic insertion and
extraction.

The function names are composed of the prefix **pqu_**, the user-defined type
**T** and the method name. E.g `pqu_int` with `#define T int`.

A user-provided Compare can be supplied to change the ordering, e.g. using
greater<T> would cause the smallest element to appear as the top().

Working with a priority_queue is similar to managing a heap in some random
access container, with the benefit of not being able to accidentally invalidate
the heap.

## Member types

`T`                     value type

`A` being `pqu_T`       container type

`I` being `pqu_T_it`    iterator type (hidden)

There is no `B` node type.

## Member functions

    A init (int T_compare(T*,T*))

constructs the priority_queue.

    free (A* self)

destructs the priority_queue.

    A copy (A* self)

returns a copy of the container.

## Element access

    T* top (A* self)

access the first element

## Capacity

    int empty (A* self)

checks whether the container is empty

    size_t size (A* self)

returns the number of elements

    size_t max_size ()

returns the maximum possible number of elements, hard-coded to 2GB (32bit).

    size_t capacity (A* self)

returns the number of elements that can be held in currently allocated storage

## Modifiers

    push (A* self, T value)

inserts the element

    emplace (A* self, T* value)

constructs elements in-place. (C++11)

    pop (A* self)

removes the top element

    swap (A* self, A* other)

swaps the contents of both containers.

No [algorithm](algorithm.md) applicable, as we have no iterators.
