# ryu

Convert floating point numbers to strings in their shortest, most accurate
representation.

This implementation consists mostly of the code taken directly from the
original work in the [ulfjack/ryu](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu) project,
with the additon of a new `ryu_string` function, that provides a little extra
safety and convenience.

Also, this library is a single self-contained C file for easily adding to
exising projects.

## Usage

```C
// ryu_string converts a double into a string representation that is copied
// into the provided C string buffer.
//
// Returns the number of characters, not including the null-terminator, needed
// to store the double into the C string buffer.
// If the returned length is greater than nbytes-1, then only a parital copy
// occurred.
//
// The format is one of
//   'e' (-d.ddddedd, a decimal exponent)
//   'E' (-d.ddddEdd, a decimal exponent)
//   'f' (-ddd.dddd, no exponent)
//   'g' ('e' for large exponents, 'f' otherwise)
//   'G' ('E' for large exponents, 'f' otherwise)
//   'j' ('g' for large exponents, 'f' otherwise) (matches javascript format)
//   'J' ('G' for large exponents, 'f' otherwise) (matches javascript format)
size_t ryu_string(double d, char fmt, char *dst, size_t nbytes)
```

## Example

```C
char buf[32];
size_t n = ryu_string(-112.89123883, 'f', buf, sizeof(buf));
if (n >= sizeof(buf)) {
 // Buffer is too small to store the floating point as a string.
}
printf("%s\n", buf);

// Output: -112.89123883
```
